    <h2>Welcome to Scrapy</h2>

    <blockquote>
    Scrapy is a high level scraping and web crawling framework for writing
    spiders to crawl and parse web pages for all kinds of purposes, from
    information retrieval to monitoring or testing web sites.
    </blockquote>
    
    <p>
    We're currently preparing the first official release of Scrapy with a
    very stable API. At the moment we consider the API quite stable, and
    we're writing documentation, tutorials and examples to make it easier
    to start using it.
    </p>

    <p> 
    Please start by reading <a href="/docs/">the documentation</a> and check
    out the community resources where you can ask for further help while we
    improve the documentation.</p>

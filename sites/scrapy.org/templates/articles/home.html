    <h3>Project status</h3>

    <p>
    We're currently preparing the first official release of Scrapy with a
    very stable API. At the moment we consider the API quite stable, and
    we're writing documentation, tutorials and examples to make it easier
    to start using it.
    </p>

    <h3>Where to start?</h3>

    <p> 
    Please start by reading <a href="/docs/">the documentation</a> and checking
    out the community resources where you can ask for further help while we
    finish improving the documentation.

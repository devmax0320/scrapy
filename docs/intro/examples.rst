Examples
========

The best way to learn is with examples. For this reason, there is an example
Scrapy project named dirbot_, that you can use to play and learn more about
Scrapy. It contains the dmoz spider described in the tutorial.

This dirbot_ project is available at: https://github.com/scrapy/dirbot

It contains a README file with a detailed description of the project contents.

If you're familiar with git, you can checkout the code. Otherwise you can
download a tarball or zip file of the project by clicking on `Downloads`_.

Other sources for examples
==========================

1. There is a site for sharing code snippets (spiders, middlewares, extensions)
called `Scrapy snippets`_.

2. There is also a `Scrapy Recipes`_ page on the wiki that contains code
snippets for performing not-so-trivial tasks. This contains code posted before
the `Scrapy snippets`_ site was lunched. New code should be posted there.

Experimental features
=====================

This section documents experimental features that may become stable in the
future, but whose API is not yet stable. Use them with caution, and subscribe
to the `mailing lists <http://scrapy.org/community/>`_ to be notified of any
changes. 

This section may also contain documentation which is outdated or incomplete (as
it's not revised so frequently), or documentation which overlaps with existing
(stable) documentation and needs to be manually merged, use at your own risk.

.. warning::

   This documentation is a work in progress, use at your own risk.

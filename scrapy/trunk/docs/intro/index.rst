   If you're new to Python_, you might want to start by getting an idea of what
   the language is like, to get the most out of Scrapy (since Scrapy is 100%
   Python).

   If you're new to programming and want to start with Python, take a look at
   `this list of Python resources for non-programmers`_.

   If you're already familiar with other languages, and want to learn Python
   quickly, we recommend `Dive Into Python`_.

Useful Firefox add-ons for scraping
===================================

Here is a list of useful Firefox add-ons you can use to make the scraping
process easier, faster and more comfortable.

Firebug
=======

`Firebug`_ is a widely known tool among web developers and it's also very
useful for scraping. In particular, its `Inspect Element`_ feature comes very
handy when you need to construct the XPaths for extracting data because it
allows you to view the HTML code of each page element while moving your mouse
over them.

See :ref:`topics-firebug` for a detailed guide on how to use Firebug with
Scrapy.

XPather
=======

`XPather`_ allows you to test XPath expressions directly on the pages.

XPath Checker
=============

`XPath Checker`_ is another Firefox add-on for testing XPaths on your pages.

Tamper Data
===========

`Tamper Data`_ is a Firefox add-on which allows you to view and modify the HTTP
request headers sent by Firefox. Firebug also allows to view HTTP headers, but
not to modify them.

Firecookie
==========

`Firecookie`_ makes it easier to view and manage cookies. You can use this
extension to create a new cookie, delete existing cookies, see list of cookies
for current site, manage cookies permissions and a lot more.
